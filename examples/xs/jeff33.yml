    This defines a library based on the JEFF-3.3 evaluations for
    neutron cross-sections and thermal scattering laws, and on
    ENDF-B/VIII.0 for gamma photoatomic reactions and atomic
    relaxation.

    Some evaluations from other libraries are used instead
    or in addition to JEFF-3.3 evaluations:
    C0:     JEFF-3.3 contains C0 and C13 isotopes of carbon. Since
            using C0 can cause some issues running the same problem
            with multiple libraries, I prefer to remove them and
            use ENDF-B/VIII.0 carbon instead. Normally you would also
            build TSL libraries using C0, I substitute it for C12.
    C12:    See C0
    C13:    See C0. The C13 evaluation of JEFF-3.3 is faulty anyway.
    Ta180:  OpenMC wrongly defines natural Ta as containing Ta180
            instead of Ta180M because ENDF-B/VIII.0 has no Ta180M
            evaluation. Since JEFF-3.3 has no Ta180, materials
            containing Ta will crash simulations.
    O17:    The O17 evaluation of JEFF-3.3 is faulty. I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0
            evaluation instead.
