summary: A library based on the ENDF-B/VII.1 evaluations.
description: |
  This defines a library based on the ENDF-B/VII.1 evaluations for
  neutron cross-sections and thermal scattering laws, and on
  ENDF-B/VIII.0 for gamma photoatomic reactions and atomic
  relaxation. It also fills the gap in naturally occuring nuclides
  that don't have data in ENDF-B/VII.1 with ENDF-B/VIII.0.
  Default temperatures are chosen to match those provided by
  libraries provided by the official OpenMC website.
  
  C0:     ENDF-B/VII.1 only contains the C0 isotope of carbon. Since
          using C0 can cause some issues running the same problem
          with multiple libraries, I prefer to remove it and
          use ENDF-B/VIII.0 carbon instead. Normally you would also
          build TSL libraries using C0, I substitute it for C12.
  O17:    Occurs naturally but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
          I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
  Ne*:    Occurs naturally but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
          I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
  Yb*:    Occurs naturally but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
          I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
  Os*:    Occurs naturally but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
          I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
  Pt*:    Occurs naturally but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
          I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
