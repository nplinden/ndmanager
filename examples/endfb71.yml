    This defines a library based on the ENDF-B/VII.1 evaluations for
    neutron cross-sections and thermal scattering laws, and on
    ENDF-B/VIII.0 for gamma photoatomic reactions and atomic
    relaxation.
    Some evaluations from other libraries are used instead
    or in addition to ENDF-B/VII.1 evaluations:
    C0:     ENDF-B/VII.1 only containes the C0 isotope of carbon. Since
            using C0 can cause some issues running the same problem
            with multiple libraries, I prefer to remove it and
            use ENDF-B/VIII.0 carbon instead. Normally you would also
            build TSL libraries using C0, is substitute it for C12.
    O17:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
            I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
    Ne*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
            I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
    Yb*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
            I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
    Os*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
            I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
    Pt*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
            I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
