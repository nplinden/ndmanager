# This defines a library based on the ENDF-B/VII.1 evaluations for
# neutron cross-sections and thermal scattering laws, and on
# ENDF-B/VIII.0 for gamma photoatomic reactions and atomic
# relaxation.
#
# Some evaluations from other libraries are used instead
# or in addition to ENDF-B/VII.1 evaluations:
# C0:     ENDF-B/VII.1 only containes the C0 isotope of carbon. Since
#         using C0 can cause some issues running the same problem
#         with multiple libraries, I prefer to remove it and
#         use ENDF-B/VIII.0 carbon instead. Normally you would also
#         build TSL libraries using C0, is substitute it for C12.
# O17:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
#         I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
# Ne*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
#         I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
# Yb*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
#         I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
# Os*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
#         I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
# Pt*:    Occurs naturaly but is absent from ENDF-B/VII.1. 
#         I use the ENDF-B/VIII.0 evaluation instead.
